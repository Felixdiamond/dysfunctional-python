# Dysfunctional Python Interpreter

Welcome to the Dysfunctional Python Interpreter, a unique and challenging way to run your Python scripts!

Noobs use ``` python script.py``` while 
REAL programmers use ``` dyspython script.py``` &nbsp;ðŸ˜Ž

## Features

- **Code Obfuscation**: Your code is obfuscated before execution, adding an extra layer of challenge.
- **Guess the Output**: You must correctly guess the output of your script before it's revealed.
- **Partial Revelation**: Incorrect guesses provide partial revelations of the correct output.
- **Scoring System**: Earn points based on your guessing speed, attempts, and code complexity.
- **Time Tracking**: Race against the clock to improve your score.
- **Code Complexity Bonus**: More complex scripts offer higher potential scores.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Felixdiamond/dysfunctional-python.git
   cd dysfunctional-python
   ```

2. Run the setup script:
   ```
   python setup.py
   ```

3. Restart your terminal or source your shell configuration file.

## Usage

Run your Python scripts using the `dyspython` command:

```
dyspython your_script.py
```

## How It Works

1. Your script is obfuscated and displayed.
2. You're prompted to guess the output of your script.
3. Incorrect guesses reveal parts of the correct output.
4. Keep guessing until you get it right!
5. Receive a score based on your performance.

## Tips for High Scores

- Familiarize yourself with Python's output formatting.
- Start with simple scripts and work your way up.
- Pay attention to the partial revelations for clues.
- Try to guess quickly, but accuracy is key!
